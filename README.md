## Install

``` sh
pip install my_autograd
```

## How to use

Derive from the class `Value`. Use that to define the scalar values that
you will use to implement backpropagation. Use the `backward()` method
to compute the gradients.

``` python
# Define a Linear layer
w = Value(3.0, label='w')
b = Value(2.0, label='b')
x = Value(1.0, label='x')

z = w * x + b; z.label = 'z'

y = z.relu(); y.label = 'y'

# Compute the gradients
y.backward()

print('dz/dw =', w.grad)
print('dz/db =', b.grad)
```

    NameError: name 'Value' is not defined
